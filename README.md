# Gesture-Controlled Volume using MediaPipe and PyCaw

This project utilizes computer vision with MediaPipe and audio control with PyCaw to create a gesture-controlled volume adjustment system. It detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe, calculates the distance between two specific landmarks, and adjusts the system volume accordingly.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the necessary Python packages before running the code. You can use either `pip` or `conda` to install the required dependencies:

### Using pip

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pyautogui comtypes pycaw
```

### Using conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge opencv mediapipe numpy pyautogui
pip install comtypes pycaw
```

## Running the Code

To run the script for controlling volume (`inst2.py`), execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python inst2.py
```

This will launch the gesture-controlled volume adjustment system, allowing you to control the system volume by making specific hand gestures.

Feel free to customize the code or experiment with different hand gestures to suit your preferences.
```

This README provides a brief overview of the project, lists the required dependencies, and gives instructions on how to run the `inst2.py` script for controlling the volume. Adjust the instructions as needed based on your project structure and requirements.
